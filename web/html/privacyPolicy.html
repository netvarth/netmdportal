							<p>Your privacy is important to NetLIMS. So we've developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
							<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
							<p>Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. 
You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with NetLIMS. Netvarth and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. 
NetLIMS may collect personal information when you create a NetLIMS account, purchase a product, download a software (or update) we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.
</p>
							<h2>How we use your personal information</h2>
							<p>	The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on NetLIMS's latest software updates and upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising. 
	We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
	From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with NetLIMS, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
	We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve NetLIMS's products, services, and customer communications.
</p>
							<h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
							<p>As you navigate the Company's Web sites, the Company may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies ("Web Site Navigational Information"). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and the actions you take on the Company's Web sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked). If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
NetLIMS's website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies". This helps us better understand user behavior, tells us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitates and measures the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
NetLIMS and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with NetLIMS more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the NetLIMS Online Store. Knowing your country and language ? and if you are an educator, your school ? helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, product serial numbers, and information about your computer or device helps us register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your cloud service, and provide you with better customer service. 
If you want to disable cookies in your browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the NetLIMS website will not be available once cookies are disabled. 
As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. NetLIMS may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the NetLIMS website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
</p>
							<h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
							<p>The Company may share Data about the Customers with the Company's agents so that these agents can contact Customers and Visitors who have provided contact information on our behalf.

The Company does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.
The Company reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information of the Company's Customers or Visitors if required by law or if the Company reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary to protect the Company's rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
</p>
							<h2>Protection of Personal Information</h2>
							<p>NetLIMS takes precautions - including administrative, technical, and physical measures - to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. 
When you use some NetLIMS products, services, or applications or post on an NetLIMS forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.
</p>
							<h2>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</h2>
							<p>NetLIMS makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
The Company's Customers use the Service to host data and information ("Customer Data"). The Company will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the Terms and Conditions Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records of Customer Data may be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issues, or suspected violation of the Terms and Conditions Agreement, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their usernames and passwords.
</p>
							<h2>Third-Party Sites and Services</h2>
							<p>NetLIMS websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>
							<h2>International Users</h2>
